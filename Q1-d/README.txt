Q: Why is the remove faseter in linked list than in an array?
Ans:
    Because linked lists have the remove method built in which is defined within the class and they are meant to handle such an operation in their very nature while 
    arrays are just contageous blocks of memory and they doesnot think about removing they just reserve a block of memory to a segment of data and remove option involves
    the array indexex backwards afetr removal therefor takes more time than linked lists in arrays.
