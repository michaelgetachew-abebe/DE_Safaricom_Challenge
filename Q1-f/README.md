Q: Explain method overloading and overriding in java?
Ans:
    Method overloading is compile time polymorphism. In method overloading, more than one method shares the same method name with a different signature in the class. In method overloading, the return type can or can not be the same, but we have to change the parameter because, in java, we can not achieve method overloading by changing only the return type of the method.  
    while
    Method overriding is is a Run time polymorphism. In method overriding, the derived class provides the specific implementation of the method that is already provided by the base class or parent class. In method overriding, the return type must be the same or co-variant (return type may vary in the same direction as the derived class).
