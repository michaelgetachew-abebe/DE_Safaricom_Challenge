Q: The difference between Interfaces and Abstract Classes
Ans:
    Interfaces
        1)Can only have final static variables. An interface can never change its own state.
        2)A class can implement multiple interfaces.
        3)Can be implemented with the implements keyword. An interface can also extend interfaces.

    Abstract Class
        1)Can have any kind of instance or static variables, mutable or immutable.
        2)A class can extend only one abstract class.
        3)Can only be extended.
